# FuzzyBug
Soon to be extensive multi-layer website vulnerability scanner



--May not use gumbo in the future.
- fixing and sorting web response data.
- fixing connection logic (going to further enhance connection establishment and redirects)
- payload mechanisms + pattern matching algo implementing .

-reducing time complexity and thread overheads. - O(n) where possible.


- will soon set up a data encryption system with socks5 proxy redirects for any web communications.
-- issue will be response and request times due to relays.(compromise open relay servers?) .


- need to fully look through vm logic and make sure its as full proof as possible before open enviroment use.
